The skills to build with maps and location data are in demand across all industries, from research to logistics to journalism.

At Mapbox, we work with instructors and students across disciplines to connect the classroom to the latest our platform has to offer: Design beautiful maps in Mapbox Studio, develop interactive web maps with Mapbox GL JS, and use our APIs and kits to build location-based games and mobile app.

Signing up for a [Mapbox account](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) is free and easy! You can use either your personal or university account - it's up to you! Additionally, Mapbox has a generous free tier that covers most student and instructor projects, but if a popular project does surpass it the [Community Team](https://support.mapbox.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000301392) is here to help with coupons!
